# Debugging App

This app represents a REST API for a book management system. There are a few problems with the app however. The basic functionality of the app should be as follows:

- [x] Contains libraries and books
- [x] Can fetch a list of all books across all libraries
- [x] Can fetch a list of all libraries
- [x] Can fetch a list of all books in a particular library
- [x] Can add a book to a library
- [x] Can update the author and name of a book
- [x] Can remove a book from a library
